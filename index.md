## About Me

Welcome to my webpage! I’m Yixiao(yee shiaw) Li, a 4th-year Ph.D student in [Machine Learning Ph.D. Program](https://ml.gatech.edu/phd) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu). I’m interested in large language models (LLMs). I am so fortunate to work with Assistant Professor [Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/) in FLASH (Foundations of LeArning Systems for alcHemy) research group. I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).
